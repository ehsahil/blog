Swiftness is a macOS productivity tool for bug hunters and security professionals to intensify penetration testing process with checklist and notes features.

SecurityEscape developed Swiftness for handling their day to day clients’ application auditing, later, They planned to make it public and we have been working on a lot of things to make it ready for the public. Finally, v0.2 is out. Now it has,

*   Multiple Checklist Management based on the type of targets.
*   Notes to intensify testing process by storing endpoints and specific data of a target
*   Redesigned Menu Bar

I use Swiftness to regularly check endpoints and recon data of different targets I work on.

Swiftness also comes with inbuilt templates and checklist, you can download and import it here.
