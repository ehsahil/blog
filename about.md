I'm an information technology and security enthusiast, with more than five years of practical experience in the information security industry. I've been into research and security auditing for more than a hundred different websites and applications including almost every top internet giant.

Programming and adapting new technologies occupy my remaining time. I'm passionate about gaining expertise in every area of interest I explore which adds varied experience to my profile. 

I've alerted hundreds of websites including every top internet company with various security vulnerabilities I could identify through my expertise in this domain. I've also been thanked, acknowledged and rewarded by most of these billion dollar organizations whom I've contributed. 

My constantly growing skill set presently consists of penetration testing, manual security assessments, website security auditing, vulnerability assessments, mobile app security auditing, python, and PHP programming.
